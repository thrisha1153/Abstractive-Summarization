**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In today's fast-paced and information-rich world, the ability to quickly access and
assimilate knowledge from lengthy documents is a persistent challenge for individuals
and professionals across diverse domains. As human beings, individuals are inherently
wired to seek efficiency in their endeavours. When faced with the prospect of gaining
insights from voluminous documents, the natural inclination is to avoid the daunting task
of reading the entirety of the content. Instead, people yearn for methods that empower
them to swiftly grasp the essential information, often by scanning the main points. 


**SUMMARIZATION**

Summarization is the process of condensing long documents into a shorter one by
preserving the most important words or phrases or contents. In other words, it is reducing
the length of the document by keeping only the key contents of the document. This plays
an especially significant role in every individualâ€™s day-to-day life by saving time and
gaining more knowledge. Summarization is of two types of namely Extractive
Summarization and Abstractive Summarization. Extractive Summarization is the process
of extracting vital information from a document without changing the original sentences
from the document. It is the process of distilling the necessary information from a
document. It does not create new phrases or sentences; it just takes the original one from
the given document. While abstractive summarization, understands the most vital
information from the document and creates new phrases and sentences on its own and
presents it as a summary of the given document in a meaningful way. Abstractive
summarization is more complex than extractive summarization.
